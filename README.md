# Era
A Minecraft modpack.

## Roadmap

> ### Researching
> Researching can be done at a Research Table which can be built at any stage. The more people that are researching a certain item, the faster it will be completed. Researching can be sped up by contributing resources that are related to this research. How much researching a person contributes can also be boosted by crafting items related to the research, which makes the user *familiar* with the subject.

> ### Eras
> Each era will have *at least* one age. To advance from one era to the next, you have to complete the first research of the next era.
