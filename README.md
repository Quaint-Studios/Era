# Era
Advance through time periods by researching together, crafting, and developing civilizations.

## Roadmap

> ### Researching
> Researching can be done at a Research Table which can be built at any stage. The more people that are researching a certain item, the faster it will be completed. Researching can be sped up by contributing resources that are related to this research. How much researching a person contributes can also be boosted by crafting items related to the research, which makes the user *familiar* with the subject.

> ### Eras
> Each era will have *at least* one age. To advance from one era to the next, you have to complete the first research of the next era.
>> ### Pre-Historic Era
>>> **The starter era.**
>>> #### Stone Age
>>>> ##### Paths
>>>> **Hunter:**
>>>> - Armor: (Leaf / Leather) Armor Set
>>>> - Weapons: (Wood / Stone) Spear & Javelin 
>>>> - Tools: (Wood / Stone) Pickaxe & Axe

>>>> **Gatherer:**
>>>> - Tools: (Wood / Stone) Sickle, ***more...***

>>>> ***more...***


>> ### Ancient Era

>>>> - Weapons: (Wood) Bow & Arrow, (Bronze) Sword & Javelin & Halberd & Dagger ***\[Dual Wieldable]*** & Arrow
>>>> - Tools: (Bronze) Pickaxe & Axe & ***more...***

>>>> **Magician:**
>>>> - Armor: (Cloth) Magic Armor Set
>>>> - Weapons: (Wood) Wand & Staff ***\[Two-Handed]***
>>>> - Tools: (Leather) Magic Book

> ### Starting a civilization
> A player has the option of starting their own civilization. With a `CivBlock`, they can claim the *heart* of their civilization. Upgrades come from advancing through the trees with that civilization. Having knowledge on a specific subject makes researching that topic exceptionally faster. This way you don't have to struggle twice! The more Players or NPCs in your city, the faster it grows as well.

>> #### Becoming a citizen
>> A civilization can have multiple statuses. Joining one changes depending on this status.
>>> - Isolated: These civilizations are completely closed. To enter, you must first be invited. Entering without permission is dangerous and can get you killed by any NPC guards that may be present.
>>> - Team: This is a collective society. You are free to purchase from their market and joining this society only requires that you go to the heart of the civilization and request citizenship. Civilizations can request payment for joining in the form of in-game currency, constructing a house (citizenship will be completed upon successfully claiming land), or a variety of other options.
>>> - Tourism: This is somewhat like a mix of an isolated and team-based civilization. You are free to enter and purchase from the market. But, you are not able to run


>> #### Structures
>> There are several buildings that can be erected in a claimed civilization.
>>> ##### Production Buildings
>>>> ###### Stone Quarry
>>>> ###### Lumberyard
>>>> ###### Wheat Farm
>>>> ###### ***more...***
>>> ##### Housings
>>>> ###### Player
>>>> ###### NPC
>>> ##### Shops
>>>> Players can setup shops with signs describing their shop. They can also set prices for all of the shops they own through an individual console. There's no need to walk into the shop and change them. Players can assign NPCs to their shops to handle the trades but they must be paid a small fee at least.
>>>>> **Possible ideas:** Explore ways to incentivize players to purchase from each other. Maybe even giving a trading research reward. Another avenue to explore would be to have NPCs purchase from players if the price is right. Perhaps a bartering skill can be leveled up for a specific NPC that the player employs. This bartering skill would increase the likelyhood an NPC will buy the goods right away. The higher the price is, the longer it takes to sell, the more profit you gain when it sells, and the more experience your NPC gets when it finally sells.
